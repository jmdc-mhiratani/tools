# Dependency Security Management Policy

**Policy Version**: 1.0
**Effective Date**: 2025-09-18
**Review Cycle**: Quarterly
**Owner**: Security Engineering Team

## Policy Overview

This document establishes the security requirements and procedures for managing Python package dependencies in the PDF2PNG/PDF2PPTX project, ensuring enterprise-grade security and compliance.

## Security Principles

### 🛡️ Core Security Tenets
1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
2. **Least Privilege**: Minimal dependency footprint
3. **Continuous Monitoring**: Proactive vulnerability detection
4. **Rapid Response**: Swift security patch deployment
5. **Auditability**: Complete dependency security traceability

## Dependency Classification

### 📦 Production Dependencies (Critical Security)
**Security Level**: CRITICAL
- Requirements: Must be latest secure version
- Review Frequency: Weekly automated, monthly manual
- Approval Process: Security team approval required for changes
- Vulnerability Response: 24-hour patch requirement

**Current Production Dependencies**:
- `PyMuPDF`: PDF processing engine
- `python-pptx`: Office document generation
- `Pillow`: Image processing library

### 🔧 Development Dependencies (Standard Security)
**Security Level**: HIGH
- Requirements: Latest stable version with security patches
- Review Frequency: Monthly automated, quarterly manual
- Approval Process: Development lead approval sufficient
- Vulnerability Response: 72-hour patch requirement

**Current Development Dependencies**:
- `mypy`: Static type analysis
- `black`: Code formatting
- `pytest`: Testing framework
- `pytest-cov`: Coverage analysis

## Version Pinning Strategy

### 🎯 Semantic Version Ranges
```
Format: >=MINIMUM_SECURE,<NEXT_MAJOR
Example: Pillow>=11.0.0,<12.0.0
```

#### Rationale:
- **Lower Bound**: Ensures minimum security requirements
- **Upper Bound**: Prevents unexpected breaking changes
- **Patch/Minor Updates**: Automatic security fixes allowed
- **Major Updates**: Require manual security review

### ⚠️ Prohibited Patterns
```bash
# NEVER use these unsafe patterns:
package==1.0.0        # Blocks security patches
package>=1.0.0        # No stability guarantee
package~=1.0.0        # Too restrictive for security
package                # Completely unpinned (dangerous)
```

### ✅ Approved Patterns
```bash
# Security-optimized patterns:
package>=1.26.0,<1.27.0    # Secure range
package>=1.0.0,<2.0.0      # Major version stability
```
